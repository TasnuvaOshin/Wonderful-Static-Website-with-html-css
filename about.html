The fact that Bengalis are pretty awesome is a no-brainer. You don't meet bongs, they happen to you. But sometimes, the burden of all that awesomeness becomes a bit much to bear, and we tend to come off a little too strong.So, despite the fact that Bengalis are well loved across the nation
One thing that even a true blue Bengali would admit to is that we're incredibly loud. We're conversationalists and have a point to make about literally everything. Basically, if you hand us a bhaar of cha and a cigarette, we'll rattle off on autopilot, discussing and debating on anything and everything under the sky. In our jest however, we often fail to realize that our brutal honesty isn't always welcome.
