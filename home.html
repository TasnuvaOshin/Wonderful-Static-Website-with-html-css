Bangladeshis eat Bhat (boiled rice) as their staple food and major intake; about 70 percent of what they eat is based on rice, which is their main source of carbohydrate, though health conscious people take rooti or chapati (wheat-based carbohydrate). Unlike other foods, bhat is eaten after mixing it with curry. Generally there is Bhaji (fry) and Bharta (mash), basically made of countless varieties of vegetables and fishes. Then they take a Jhol of different vegetables, cooked separately or mixed or added with fish. They also take dal (soup made of pulses) and have different kinds of ghonto and shukto or Chutni (pickles) to enhance taste.

Bangladesh has about a thousand varieties of fish, the size of which may vary from a quarter of an inch to about twelve feet. All of these are fresh water fish and can be found in small rural ponds and all types of inland water bodies and even in the submerged fields of paddy or jute. Salt-water fish are also avails abundance. Bangladesh can boast of a wide range of Shutki (sun-dried) of fresh-water and salt-water fishes. Dishes made of Shutki are popular and delicious and feature in typical traditional meals.
Rice is the main staple food of Bangladeshi people and it is served with a wide range of curries.
